# chrome-extension-delete-malicious-tech-blog
I hate tech blogs that start in a conversational style. 
Delete them from google search result.

## Objective
In order to have a comfortable engineering life, technical information sources are essential, and we need an environment where we can efficiently search for official pages of middleware and technical blogs, etc.
Recently, however, there has been an increase in the number of malicious technical blogs that begin in a conversational style and occupy the top search positions. 
These are so pernicious that they keep the information we want secret, make it hard to find, and interfere with our comfortable engineering life.

We have a mission.
* Remove such tech blogs from the search results and get back to our comfortable life.
